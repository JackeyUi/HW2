# HW2
# The files used are in the "main_" dir.
(1) Set up:
I/O(3.3V for the Vcc):
AnalogIn : 
"A0" for the voltage input after the RC filiter  
"A3" for the button input "UP"
"A4" for the button input "DOWN"
"A5" for the button input "CONFIRM"
AnalogOut :
"D7" for the voltage output generated by the DAC
uLCD : 
"D0", "D1", "D2", "5V", "GND"

Copy the "main.cpp" and "FFT.py"
Compile the main.cpp

There are two lines in the uLCD : "240 Hz", "720 Hz", and a red "<" for the current selection.
You can use the "UP" and "DOWN" button to select the freq. for the DAC.

Before push the "CONFIRM" button, you need to compile the "FFT.py" to get the sample values.
After "CONFIRM", the red "<" should turn into white.
About 30~60 seconds later, you can get a graphic made by the "FFT.py"
(2) Results
The result of "240 Hz" would be looked like the "HW2_Sample_240Hz.JPG"
The result of "720 Hz" would be looked like the "HW2_Sample_720Hz.JPG"
We can compare with the result measured by the picoscope ("HW2_DAC.JPG")
